## What is minecraft bingo?
Minecraft Bingo is a gamemode in Minecraft in which teams battle in order to collect items on their bingo card.
The first team to reach a completed row, column or diagonal wins the game.
Collecting items is simply done through the vanilla game experience of minecraft.

## Usage
Players that have OP on the server have access to all commands. 
Before being able to start the game, a player needs to create teams with the /team command. 
Other settings can be configured as explained in the commands section below. 
As soon as the game is started, teams are scattered across the map (players within teams are grouped together). 
The teams work together to gather the items on their bingo card. 
If a team successfully completed the card, the game ends. 
When, however, the time limit is reached, a winner is decided based on the number of items collected by each of the teams. 
The team with the highest number of items wins, or the game ends in a tie.
Note that the bingo card can be right-clicked in order to view which items need to be gathered.

## Install
The plugin can be downloaded from one of the [releases](https://github.com/Extremelyd1/minecraft-bingo/releases) or compiled yourself using Spigot.
The plugin requires either a [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) or [Paper](https://papermc.io/) server running version 1.16.4. 
Move the `.txt` files and the `images/images.zip` in the `item_data` folder to `<server>/plugins/MinecraftBingo/item_data`. 
Then unzip the `images/images.zip` archive.
The first time you run the plugin a config file will be generated in `<server>/plugins/MinecraftBingo`, in which you can edit some configuration settings.

## Commands
#### Team manage command
- `/team [random|add|remove]`
  - `/team random <number of teams> [-e] [players...]` Create a set number of teams dividing the players randomly over them. If given a list of player names, it will only create teams with those players (or exclude those player if the flag `-e` is given).
  - `/team add <player name> <team name>` Add a player to a given team  
  Possible team names are: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Pink, Aqua, Orange, Gray
  - `/team remove <player name>` Remove a player from a given team

#### Game start/end commands
- `/start` Start the game
- `/end` End the game

#### Configuration commands  
- `/pvp` Enable/disable PvP
- `/maintenance` Enable maintenance mode (this will disallow all non-OP players from joining)
- `/wincondition <full|lines|lockout> [number]` Change the wincondition to either a full card, a number of lines (rows, columns or diagonals) to complete in order to win or lockout. 
  In case of 'lines' or 'lockout' you can specify a number to indicate how many lines needed to be completed, or after how many collections an item locks.
- `/itemdistribution <S> <A> <B> <C> <D>` Change the item distribution scales, the number of S, A, B, C, and D tier items that appear on the bingo card. 
  These numbers must add up to 25.
- `/timer <enable|disable|length>` Enable/disable the timer or set the length of the timer (the length can be specified in hours/minutes/seconds, such as `/timer 10m` or `/timer 1h20m30s`)

#### Miscellaneous commands
- `/bingo` Check the items on the card
- `/card` Receive a new bingo card (if somehow lost)
- `/reroll` Reroll the items on the bingo card
- `/coords [message]` Sends your current coordinates to your team (optionally with a message)
- `/all [message]` Allows players to talk to all players in the game, bypassing the team chat

## World generation
The plugin offers the ability to pre-generate worlds to reduce chunk generation lag during gameplay.
This feature currently is only functional on [Paper](https://papermc.io/) (a different minecraft server implementation).
The following command can be used to manage this:
- `/generate start <numWorlds>` Start pre-generating worlds and storing them in zip format
- `/generate stop` Stop pre-generating worlds  

This command only works if the config value `pregeneration-mode` is enabled.
The config file also include two parameters that can tweak/boost the chunk generation based on the processing power of your machine.
The `ticks-per-cycle` parameter denotes the time between chunk generation cycles and `chunks-per-cycle` denotes how many chunks it should generate in a single cycle.
A lower `ticks-per-cycle` and higher `chunks-per-cycle` will require more RAM and processing speed.
Note that using this feature and increasing these parameters drastically may crash your server.
